# README for api-admin Project

The api-admin project serves as a backend API service designed to manage administrative tasks for a vendor marketplace platform called VendorHub. It focuses on handling merchant onboarding processes, including the submission, review, approval, and rejection of merchant applications. By restructuring the original monolithic server code from the "admin" codebase into a more modular MVC-like architecture (with controllers, services, repositories, and models), this project improves maintainability and scalability. Key functionalities include creating temporary merchant accounts upon approval, logging administrative actions, and sending mock email notifications for application status updates. The in-memory storage simulates database operations for development purposes, while the schema is defined using Drizzle ORM for potential migration to a real PostgreSQL database.

Beyond application management, the api-admin extends to overseeing active merchants, such as updating their status (active, suspended, inactive) and commission tiers/rates. It also incorporates dispute resolution capabilities, allowing admins to review and resolve customer-merchant disputes related to orders. Dashboard statistics provide insights into total revenue from commissions, active merchant counts, order volumes, and pending applications. All admin actions are logged for auditing, and access is restricted via simple token-based authentication (intended for replacement with JWT in production). Tests are structured into unit, integration, and E2E categories, though currently placeholders, to ensure reliability as features expand.

Technologically, the project is built with Express.js and TypeScript, utilizing Zod for input validation and Vite for development/build processes. It shares schema definitions with related projects for consistency and includes utilities for logging and email mocking. The Dockerfile enables containerization for deployment, and the overall goal is to provide a secure, efficient admin backend that can integrate with a frontend dashboard, supporting the growth of the VendorHub ecosystem while maintaining focus on core admin workflows like compliance, revenue management, and conflict resolution.
